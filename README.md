Open-source software is a program that has publicly available code which anyone with technical expertise can use, modify and distribute.

The term open source was introduced in the late 1990s by The Open Source Initiative (OSI).
These type of software solutions don't always solve the same problems. In fact, most open-source software is geared towards different niche solutions.
However, because it is accessible to the general public, it is typically very easy to obtain and incorporate into digital solutions.

## Note
Now, it is important to remember that just because open source software is free to use, it doesn't mean that just anyone can use it. Open-source software refers to lines of code (and its variations) that are available.
So, depending on the type of this software, you'll likely still need a qualified software developer to inspect that code, customize the software to your specifications, and integrate it into your current operations.

## Open Source Software vs. Free Source Software 

Very often free source software is used as a synonym with open source software.
Though similar, these two are different types of software.

## Both of them offer similar licenses but share different ideologies.  
Richard Stallman introduced the concept of free source software back in the 1980s. Its main goal was that all users have the right to operate, copy, share, study, change, and improve this software.

Open source software, on the other hand, was introduced in the late 1990s by a group of individuals as a reaction to the limitations of free source software. 
The main difference they presented was that they changed the emphasis from freedom to security. And, they also brought other pragmatic benefits like transparency and cost savings. 

All free source software can qualify as open source software. However, not all open source software can be free.
For instance, Open Watcom is an integrated development environment whose license cannot be modified and used privately.

## The Most Popular Open Source Software Licenses
Open source software licenses allow users and commercial companies to run, modify and share different sets of software code.
In other words, these licenses are legal contracts between the creator and the user. They imply that anyone with a license can use the software under specific conditions.  
They are mostly available free of charge and sometimes may have restrictions.
For example, users may be confined to preserve the name of the authors. Or, it may also happen that they are not able to redistribute the licensed software under the same license only.

There are over 200 licenses of this type.
## Here are the most popular:
## •	MIT license (MIT):
The users who are MIT licensed can use open source software code according to their preferences and without any restrictions. This license is also GPL-compatible meaning that users can modify the original code without affecting the resultant derivative code of the original permit.

## •	Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0):
Those who have issued an Apache license can freely run, modify and share software code. However, they must follow the terms of the Apache license which has strict rules, especially to redistribution. Thereby, users have to provide unequivocal statements verifying that files have been modified. And, they also need to include notices in their original work.

## •	3-clause BSD license (BSD-3-Clause): 
The developers who own a BSD-3-Clause license also need to include the original copyright notice, disclaimer and several other conditions that are mandatory. This license is very similar to MIT. However, the main difference is that it provides a clause that protects the original creators of the software. 

## •	GNU General Public License (GPL):
Those who write software code under GPL, must release it as open source. In other words, all the users are obliged to release the full source code and all the rights to change and share the entire code. 

## •	Common Development and Distribution License 1.0 (CDDL-1.0): 
All the users who own a CDDL can reproduce and distribute any original and derivative work. However, they cannot make any trademark, copyright or patent changes included in the contract. When developers share a modified form of the source, they must make it available under CDDL. However, if the form does not contain the original code, they don’t have to release it under CDDL. 

## NOTE
Before you start using any open source code, understand the types of licenses and its rules to stay compliant.
